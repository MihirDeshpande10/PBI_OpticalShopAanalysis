# PBI_OpticalShopAanalysis

This project delivers a Q4-2025 sales and profitability analysis for a Tier-3 city optical retail shop, where raw, inconsistent transactional data was cleaned, filtered to a quarterly view, and transformed into a realistic, decision-ready Power BI dashboard. Due to limited cost and expense visibility, client-approved assumptions were applied to model gross profit and business reinvestment while avoiding exposure of sensitive in-hand earnings. Key KPIs such as Total Sales, Total Cost (COGS), Gross Profit, Average Order Value, Orders per Day, and Business Reinvestment were built using DAX, alongside category, product, customer-demographic, and payment-mode insights. The final dashboard mirrors real-world retail economics, balances analytical accuracy with business practicality, and is suitable for both client presentation and portfolio showcase.
